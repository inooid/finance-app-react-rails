Start the server by running: ``` rails s ```

After that run: ``` gulp ```

It will live reload on every change and will start precompiling the changes
you make.

### IMPORTANT:

If you don't see any changes being fired, try and go over to:
`http://localhost:3001`

Since gulp will launch browser-reload on there.
